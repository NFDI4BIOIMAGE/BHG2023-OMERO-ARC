Worked on by: Michele Bortolomeazzi, Eik Dahms, Andrea Schrader, Torsten StÃ¶ter, Peter Zentis 


## Mutlimodal imaging ARC: MRI and LightSheet image stacks of Rat brains

Repository: https://git.nfdi4plants.org/torsten.stoeter/rat-mri-ls

* Dataset consists of MRI and LightSheet image stacks of four rats
* LightSheet image has ~4k z slices and 2 channels => many binary files >32k with small size ~8MB
* In total the dataset is large >250GB
* Due to small file size Git-LFS is not used, which blows up .git directory as well
* Each file needs to be annotated in isa.assay.xslx => 32k lines in spreadsheet


## Vendor specific image container vs extracted open formats in ARC: CLSM z-stacks and MIPs

MIPs: maximum intensity projection

Repository : https://git.nfdi4plants.org/natural-variation-and-evolution/microscopy_collection/map-by-seq_clsm-stacks

* In this case Leica LIF files contain many images, i.e. different measurements with different parameters (samples, specimen, cultures, channels, ...)
* This is a problem with respect to metadata annotation per file as done in ARC
* ARC specs encourage accompanying open formats besides raw vendor specific data => data duplication or alternatively workflows for conversion
* Possible solution use vendor software for data conversion and processing
* BUT: the software needs to be available and important technical metadata may be lost (example: pixel sizes for maximum intensity projections in Leica software)
* Alternative workflow: use OMERO for understanding and accessing vendor specific file formats and image extraction (1->N) and perform MIP in OMERO with results moved back into ARC.
