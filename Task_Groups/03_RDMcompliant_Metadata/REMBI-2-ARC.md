# REMBI to ARC mapping initiative

## Aim
Where are the REMBI terms in an ARC. Here, we aim to map terms from REMBI to their respective counterparts in ARC metadata.

## Does REMBI cover an investigation, a study, an assay?
We understand one REMBI annotation table as follows:
- Coming from the ARC perspective this is an assay with additional derived metadata from the study and investigation level.
- Coming from the OMERO perspective....

## Spreadsheets

This is WIP using the original REMBI table from the [REMBI publication](https://rdcu.be/dtAOL) to add the [REMBI-2-ARC mapping](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0YUq1ZdS7xsUTv1QBixTy0-uE0yPC8peSNFLzRBsG0/edit?usp=sharing).

## Which terms do we map?

1) We used the "Attribute" column from the "Modules, attributes and example" table from the supplemental material of the REMBI publication.

2) Next we searched for the respective terms in the isa.xlsx files and skipped those which are exclusively annotated in additional sheets (e.g. using the Swate tool).

3) These will be considered in a last step.
