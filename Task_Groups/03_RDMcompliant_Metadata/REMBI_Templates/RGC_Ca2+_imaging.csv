For the viral injection, mice were anesthetized (induction, 4% isoflurane in oxygen; maintenance, 1.8–2.0%) and kept on a heated plate (Supertech Physiological Temperature Controller) to avoid hypothermia. Both eyes were protected by saline drops or viscous eye ointment (VitA-POS, Ursapharm). The scleral surface on the left eye was exposed and a small piercing was made with a sterile 28-30G needle in between the sclera and the cornea. An injection pipette (~50µm tip diameter with 30–40° bevel) prefilled with a virus solution (~1.5 × 1014 vg mL−1 in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.001% Pluronic F68 and 0.001% FastGreen) was then inserted into the vitreous chamber approximately 1mm deep. The injection pipette was made from a borosilicate glass capillary (1B120F-3, WPI) with a pipette puller (DMZ, Zeitz) and a microgrinder (EG-45, Narishige). After a good sealing of the pipette was formed, 1.2 µL of the virus solution was injected at a rate of 10 nL s−1 using a microinjection pump (either Neurostar NanoW or WPI NanoLiter 2010) with mineral oil (Sigma, M5904) filled in the displacement space by a stainless steel plunger. The pipette was slowly withdrawn at least 5min after the completion of the injection, and the treated eye was covered with the eye ointment. The animal was then allowed to recover from anesthesia in a warmed-up chamber and brought back to its home cage.	Prior to in vivo imaging sessions, animals were habituated to stay head-fixed on a custom-made treadmill disc (8–10 habituation sessions in total over a week, each for 2h). For the imaging session, animals were kept on the treadmill with their head fixed for no longer than 2h (2–5 sessions per animal). Two-photon calcium imaging was done on a galvo-resonant multiphoton microscope (Scientifica HyperScope with SciScan 1.3 image acquisition software) equipped with a mode-locked tunable laser (InSight DS+, Spectra-Physics) and a plan fluorite objective (CFI75 LWD 16X W, Nikon). In each imaging session, we performed single-plane time-lapse recordings (field of view, approximately 0.65-by-0.65 mm) at a depth of 120–220 μm from the SC surface. The fluorescent signal (excitation wavelength, 920nm for axon-GCaMP6, GCaMP7f, and GCaMP8m; 1040nm for jRGECO1a; average laser power under the objective, 40–80mW) was bandpass-filtered (BP 527/70 or BP 650/100 after beam-splitter FF580-FDi01, Semrock) and detected with a non-descanned gallium arsenide phosphide photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu GaAsP PMT). Each frame was acquired with 1024-by-1024 pixels (16-bit depth) at 15.4Hz for RGC axonal imaging.	calcium-dependent fluorescence	GCaMP6s	RGC axon terminal
